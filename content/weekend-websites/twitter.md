# Twitter Post: weekend-websites

## Version A — 清单体

8 websites worth opening this weekend:

1. Neal.fun — scroll through 57 internet milestones, from the first email to early YouTube
2. Moodist — mix 84 ambient sounds. rain + distant train + soft static
3. GummySearch — sorts 130k+ subreddits by pain points and feature requests
4. Godly — the most visually striking websites, updated daily
5. SEESAW — sites that just feel good to use
6. Lovable — describe an app, get a working project in minutes
7. bolt.new — build and deploy a web app entirely in your browser
8. Griply — goals, habits, and tasks in one clean space

Most need no signup.

## Version B — 故事体

I went down a rabbit hole this week and came back with 8 websites I genuinely didn't want to close.

One lets you scroll through 57 internet artifacts — from the first email ever sent to the birth of YouTube.

Another mixes 84 ambient sounds so you can build your own focus playlist. Rain + distant train + soft static. I left it running for hours.

And if you're building something, GummySearch sorts 130k+ subreddits by what people actually want — pain points, feature requests, money talk.

The rest are just as good. Design inspiration, AI builders, a clean goal tracker.

## Version C — 观点体

Hot take: your weekend browser tabs say more about you than your bookmarks ever will.

Here are 8 sites I'd actually keep open on a Saturday:

— An interactive internet history museum (Neal.fun)
— A sound mixer with 84 ambient layers (Moodist)
— A Reddit research tool that finds real user pain points (GummySearch)
— Two design galleries with completely different vibes (Godly vs SEESAW)
— Two AI builders that ship full-stack apps from a prompt (Lovable, bolt.new)
— A goal tracker that helps you figure out what actually matters this week (Griply)

No signup walls. No fluff. Just good websites.
